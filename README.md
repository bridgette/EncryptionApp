Create a Windows Phone app with unbreakable* encryption!

Create a Windows Phone app with unbreakable* encryption! This app will use PGP encryption to exchange messages between two devices. First, a random secret key will be generated on one device and shared to the other. Then, messages can be securely exchanged over data or wifi and decrypted on the other client.
